The improved ActionScript 3 code utilizes the null-safe operator or a conditional operator to prevent `NullPointerExceptions`:

```actionscript
//Using the null-safe operator (AS3 later versions only):
public function handleEvent(event:Event):void {
  trace(myObject?.someProperty);
}

//Using conditional operator:
public function handleEvent(event:Event):void {
  trace(myObject ? myObject.someProperty : "default value");
}
```
The null-safe operator is cleaner and more concise but requires a later version of ActionScript 3. The conditional operator works in older versions as well.
