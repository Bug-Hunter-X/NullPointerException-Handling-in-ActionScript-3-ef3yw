The following ActionScript 3 code attempts to access a property of an object that might be null:

```actionscript
public function handleEvent(event:Event):void {
  if (myObject != null) {
    trace(myObject.someProperty);
  }
}
```

This code is vulnerable to a `NullPointerException` if `myObject` is null.  The `if` statement prevents the crash, but a better approach is to use the null-safe operator (`?.`) introduced in later versions of ActionScript 3, or to use a conditional operator to provide a default value:

```actionscript
//Using the null-safe operator (AS3 later versions only):
trace(myObject?.someProperty);

//Using conditional operator:
trace(myObject ? myObject.someProperty : "default value");
```
The null-safe operator is the more concise and preferred way to handle this, particularly for chained property access.
